This project utilizes a web API to pull data on twelve random employees including their photo, name, birthday, address, city, state, and more for display in an employee directory. The project utilizes JavaScript's fetch() method and promises to make the code more readable and cut down on callback hell. The twelve employees are initially displayed in a gallery-type directory. If an individual employee is clicked on, then a modal tile with more detailed information about that employee is rendered.
